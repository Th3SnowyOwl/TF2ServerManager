# The tf2 installer
is for servers and for people who intend to run thier own servers for lan or public use
im not responsible for any exploits that may occur, this is simply an install script to help you understand how to get a server hooked up
# Setup
Once you have downloaded the repository, run tf2serverinstaller.bat
you will have to type quit twice while installing, after it lets you type in console (steamcmd)
there will be a shortcut to launch the server on your desktop and in the server folder
# config
